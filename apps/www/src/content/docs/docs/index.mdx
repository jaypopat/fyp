description: Introduction to ZKFair - Trustless AI Fairness Auditing.

import { Card, CardGrid, LinkCard } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

ZKFair is a trustless platform for proving ML model fairness using Zero-Knowledge Proofs.

- **Privacy-Preserving**: Prove fairness without exposing training data or model weights
- **Trustless**: On-chain commitments + ZK proofs eliminate trusted third parties
- **Continuous**: Runtime auditing of inference queries, not just training
- **Economic Security**: Stake-based incentives with slashing for misbehavior

## How It Works

<CardGrid>
  <Card title="1. Certify" icon="approve-check">
    Provider registers model on-chain with cryptographic commitments. ZK proof verifies training fairness.
  </Card>
  <Card title="2. Serve" icon="rocket">
    Provider runs inference, issues signed receipts. Queries batched into Merkle trees on-chain.
  </Card>
  <Card title="3. Audit" icon="magnifier">
    Anyone can challenge batches. Provider must respond with ZK fairness proof within 24h.
  </Card>
  <Card title="4. Detect" icon="warning">
    Users verify receipts against blockchain. Disputes slash malicious providers.
  </Card>

## Core Components

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **CLI** | Register models, generate proofs, submit certifications |
| **Server** | Inference API with batching, receipts, audit handling |
| **Web App** | User interface with Sentinel fraud detection |
| **SDK** | `ProviderSDK` (server) and `BrowserSDK` (client) |
| **Contracts** | Model registry, batching, disputes, slashing |
| **ZK Circuits** | Training certification + fairness audit proofs |

## Protocol Phases

### Phase 1: Certification

Provider registers model with cryptographic commitments:

```bash
# Hash weights + build dataset Merkle tree
zkfair commit --dir ./my-model

# Generate ZK training proof + submit
zkfair proof generate-and-submit --weights-hash 0x...
```

### Phase 2: Serving

Provider runs inference and batches queries:

```typescript
// POST /predict
const receipt = await provider.createSignedReceipt({
  seqNum, modelId, features, prediction, timestamp
});

// Auto-batch when thresholds met
await provider.createBatchIfNeeded();
```

### Phase 3: Auditing

Anyone can challenge batches:

```typescript
// Request audit (stakes 0.00005 ETH)
requestAudit(batchId);

// Provider auto-responds with ZK proof
provider.watchAuditRequests((result) => {
  console.log(result.passed ? "PASSED" : "FAILED");
});
```

### Phase 4: Fraud Detection

Users verify receipts locally:

```typescript
const result = await verifyReceipt(receipt);

if (result.status === "FRAUD_NON_INCLUSION") {
  // Provider never batched the query
  disputeNonInclusion(receipt);
}

if (result.status === "FRAUD_INVALID_PROOF") {
  // Provider tampered with batch data
  disputeFraudulentInclusion(batchId, seqNum);
}
```

## Economic Security

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Provider Stake | 0.0001 ETH |
| Audit Stake | 0.00005 ETH |
| Dispute Stake | 0.0001 ETH |
| Audit Deadline | 24 hours |
| Grace Period | 1 hour |

**Slashing conditions:**
- Failed audit → stake to challenger
- Missed deadline → slashed
- Valid dispute → slashed, user compensated
